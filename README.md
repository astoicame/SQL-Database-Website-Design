# SQL-Database-Website-Design
This repository displays all of my portions of code that contributed to a larger group project in desinging a SQL database and website for updating and editing entries for the Younger Lab at Boston University. 


get_sort.py <- this script aquires requested data from the database and populates the Sort form with the current information
update_sort.py <- this script allows users who can bypass the password protection to update the information and resubmit, changing the database content
update_sort.html <- this provides the user interface for the above scripts to function
