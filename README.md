# SQL-Database-Website-Design
This repository displays all of my portions of code that contributed to a larger group project in desinging a SQL database and website for updating and editing entries for the Younger Lab at Boston University. Please note this website is not publicly hosted, so the scripts here do not create a functioning unit and are simply the pieces of code I contributed to the project. The website is active and private to the lab associated. 


get_sort.py <- this script aquires requested data from the database and populates the Sort form with the current information


update_sort.py <- this script allows users who can bypass the password protection to update the information and resubmit, changing the database content


update_sort.html <- this provides the user interface for the above scripts to function 

main.html <- main UI design for the website

style2.css <- style file called on in main.html

help_page.html <- HTML for the website's help page
